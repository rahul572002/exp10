An inductor (L), capacitor (C), and resistor (R) are linked in series in the electrical
circuit, which is powered by an AC voltage supply. The alternating voltage V is
supplied by the voltage source, where

                           V = Vm sin(ωt)
where,        
        Vm is the amplitude of the applied voltage, and
        ω  is the frequency of the applied voltage.                  

If q is the charge on the capacitor and I is the current flowing in the circuit at any
moment t, the voltage equation for the circuit can be written as follows:
Net EMF across the circuit: V (source voltage) = Voltage drop across resistor +
Voltage drop across capacitor + Self-induced Faraday’s emf in the inductor

          V=L(di/dt) + IR + q/C
          The inductor’s self-inductance is denoted by L.

Substituting alternating voltage for the expression,

Vm sin(ωt) = L(di/dt) + IR + q/C          …..(1) 

Let us use the analytical method to determine the instantaneous current I or its
matching phase to the applied alternating voltage V. We know that current is
equal to the rate at which electric charge flows per unit of time, i.e.,
         
         I=dq/dt

Differentiating both sides with respect to time, we get:
        
         dI/dt=d**2*q/dt**2
