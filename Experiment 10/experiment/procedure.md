### Procedure
Measuring VR, VLC and ΦR, ΦLC: 

(a) Using the multimeter/LCR meter, note down all the measured values of the
inductance, capacitance and resistance of the components provided. Also,
measure the resistance of the inductor. Calculate the d.c. resistance of the circuit.
Calculate the resonant frequency.

(b) Configure the circuit on a breadboard as shown in circuit diagram. Set the
function generator frequency Range in 10-20 KHz and Function in sinusoidal
mode. Set an input peak-to-peak voltage of 5V (say) with the oscilloscope probesset in X1 (attenuation factor= =1) position. Set the function generator probe in X1
position.

(c) Feed terminals 1,4 in the circuit diagram to channel 1 and 3,4 to channel 2 of the
oscilloscope to measure input voltage Vi and output voltage VR, respectively.
Note that terminal 4 is connected to the ground pin of the function generator and
oscilloscope. Keep the settings such that you can measure f, Vi, VR and Φ
simultaneously.

(d) Vary the frequency in the set region slowly and record VR and Vi (which may not
remain constant at the set value, guess why?). Read the frequency from
oscilloscope. Also, measure the phase shift angle ΦR with proper sign.

(e) Replace the resistor with another value and repeat steps (c) and (d). No phase
measurement is required for the second resistor.

(f) Now, interchange the probes of the function generator and oscilloscope, i.e. make
terminal 1 as the common ground so that you will measure VLC output between
terminal 3 and 1 and Vi between 4 and 1. Repeat step-(d) to record VLC, Vi and
ΦLC.
